        How it works:
        <br><br>
        1. Add your asset(s) to the liquidity manager contract
        <br><br>
        2. It automatically splits them into 3 liquidity bands (narrow, mid, wide) and gives you ownership
        <br><br>
        3. Bots keep your assets in range to effortlessly maximize your yield while you sleep
        <br><br>    
        4. Claim anytime, or double down
