        description: "Simply add your assets into a pool through the Liquidity Manager contract (yay). Your assets are automatically split into three bands: Narrow, Mid, and Wide, to ensure effective liquidity.<br/> <br/> Our system uses bots to keep your assets in range and earning yield (nice!). These bots move your assets back into range if needed, charging a small fee for their service.<br/> <br/> When you add your assets (either one type or two types) through our Liquidity Manager contract, it splits them into three bands for you and gives you ownership. <br/> <br/> The assets are optimized by an aggregator to be in the correct ratio before being deposited.If there are any leftover assets, they are refunded back to you.
